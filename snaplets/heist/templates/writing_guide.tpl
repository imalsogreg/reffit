<h2>The Reffit Style Guide</h2>
<p>Here's how you can make Reffit a nicer corner of the internet. When you see others following these guidelines, give them an upvote.</p>

<h3>Write for the community</h3>
<p>Our main goal is to build up, not tear down. The health of the community comes from the quest for improvement. When improvement means pointing out flaws in a study, try to find a way to make your criticism as constructive as possible.</p>

<h3>Less is more</h3>
<p>We want as many high-quality ideas visible on the page as possible.  That means trying to keep your idea pithy - one or two short sentences. Let your idea be judged for its content, not its rhetorical flare. If you want more space to set up or break down your comment, use your comment's Discussion leaf.</p>

<h3>Vote!</h3>
<p>If someone the point similar to the one you've been burning to write, it's fine to add your version. But don't forget to show your love for the other comment with a vote, if it was made well!</p>

<h3>Cross-posting</h3>
<p>Yes! If you wrote a thorough review on Publons, break it out into independent points for Reffit.  If you see a way to synthesize several Reffit points into a whole review for Publons, get in touch with the Reffit users whose points you want to use.</p>

<h3>Self-posting</h3>
<p>For now, you're encouraged to post reviews for your own paper, but please disclose that you're the author. Your comments will be upvoted or downvoted according to the quality of your comment or its apparent bias.</p>

<h3>Hearsay</h3>
<p>Under Summaries, Praise, and Criticisms, only post things that an educated reader could deduce from the publication. Insider information is off limits on Reffit, simply because there's no way to verify it, so it's too easy to make up. We recognize that sometimes insider information is important - please limit those comments to a Discussion leaf, where the authors will have a chance to respond to them. Or better yet, write a blog post about what you know. This policy is our attempt to balance between giving whistle-blowers a platform and protecting people against character attacks.</p>

<h3>Summaries</h3>
<p>Your goal is to boil the author's point of view down into 1-3 clear sentences. Vote on summaries according to how well the summarized meets this goal (you may have to read the paper to judge this!)</p>

<h3>Praise</h3>
<p>Point out something noteworthy about the paper - regarding its Rigor, Novelty, or Coolness.</p>

<h3>Criticism</h3>
<p>In constructive tones, point out what's unrigorous, not-novel, or uncool about said paper.</p>

<h3>Coda</h3>
<p>When you prepare for talks, you want to hold in mind: Who is my audience?  When you write a Reffit review, you want to hold in mind: What does this review do for the community? Our goal is to democritize the peer-review process, and we can only do that if we hold ourselves to very high standards in our reviews. Whether your personal goal is to advocate for a particular best-practice in data analysis, or to make ubiquitous peer-review a reality, the best way to accomplish that is to write the best content you can on Reffit.</p>
