  <strong>Reffit is in alpha</strong>. There is no SSL here yet. Your participation is hugely appreciated, please sign up and write! But be safe while I iron out the kinks.
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Don't use a password that you use on any other website</strong></li>
    <li>My programming mistake may result in anonymity slips, so <strong>don't write anything yet that you wouldn't say to the world in person.</strong></li>
    <li>I never get to see your password - it's encrypted on your computer</li>
    <li>I <strong>will not sell your e-mail address to anyone, or display it anywhere on the site</strong></li> 
    <li>Log in as user/password test/test if you want to do random testing.  I'll delete this account before beta</li>
    <li>Other content will be carried into the beta version, so write valuable things!</li>
  </ul>
  <p>A more thorough privacy policy is in the works.Feedback to imalsogreg.  I'm on gmail.  Thanks for checking Reffit out, have fun!</p>
